## Overview
The task at hand is enormous, since Mahābhārata, together with accessory texts comes up to roughly 150,000 shloka-s. At the hands of expert reciters, assuming a rate of about 60 shloka-s an hour (including time required for rehearsal before recording), this would require a 2,450.25 hours of recording effort. Beyond that, we expect roughly the same effort for closely examining and editing the recordings. Past experience with other audio products suggest that a couple of iterations of recording, checking, rerecording might be required to remove errors.

A past attempt by us (see [this archive page](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/mahAbhArata-mUla-paThanam-GP&sa=D&ust=1536608308745000)) at using volunteers to record the text has thrown up several unsurprising problems:

-   Inconsistent, unpredictable and slow progress
-   Varying quality due to varying levels of proficiency.

Nevertheless, we propose to identify and engage expert reciters with access to android phones and free mp3 recording apps (thereby bypassing studio recording costs). We will allot them chapters to record and send to us. We will then track their progress, examine the recording quality, edit as necessary and publish the final product freely on the internet.

### Workflow
- Set up recording apps (details below), go over instructions etc..
- Identify assigned portions from [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sNH1AWhhoa5VATqMdLbF652s7srTG0Raa6K-sCwDR-8/edit#gid=0).
- Make an mp3 recording you're satisfied with. (Note time-segments where editing is needed, or edit yourself.) TIP: Rehearse a small set of verses, record it, pause, repeat with next set.
- Upload to [this google drive location](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1_QBT-hoqqVMUNSLVlyMlJqZDA?usp=sharing) (but keep a copy for some time) - under a subfolder named after you.
- Rename in this way: 001-045.mp3 (or 001-045p01.mp3 001-045p02.mp3 .. if multi-part recording.)
- Solicit and provide feedback on whatsapp forum (Especially in the beginning)
- Notify coordinator (via whatsapp or add a comment in the appropriate cell of the कार्यावली-sheet; include edit requests).

#### Recording instructions
- Most importantly: shoot for good pronunciation - न vs ण, स vs श vs ष, अल्पप्राण (त) vs महाप्राण (थ), आ vs अ (esp in the end, like in उवाच). We can coach you. [Video demo](https://goo.gl/htvxdN), [शिक्षाभिप्रायः](http://vvasuki.github.io/notes/language/sanskrit/shixaa.html)
- Read without breaking sandhi-s or adding excess gaps (eg. in the end of odd pAda-s). 
- Rehearse difficult shloka-s once before unpausing and recording. In case you're having much trouble: "Before each shloka, pause the recording and rehearse until you are satisfied. Then resume and make the practiced recording. Repeat for the next shloka."
- With prose sections, plan where you will pause for breath and how it ought to sound to convey the "conversational" bhAva.
- If you make a mistake or are unsatisified, just say "punaH" and rerecord after a 3 second break. But please note that you must cut out the mistake as described in the technical instructions below.
- Bonus: Try to render appropriate bhAva (especially in emotional spots).
- If despite efforts, there are shortcomings, don't worry - we can fix or replace later.

### Technical instructions
#### Iphone setup
- Install [mp3-voice-recorder-audio-note](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mp3-voice-recorder-audio-note/id891186831?mt=8)

#### Android setup
- Install [ASR App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.asr&hl=en)
- Set up noise cancellation as needed.
- Pause and proceed during recording as needed. Don't pause in the middle of a verse to avoid jitters - only pause between verses.
- If you've made rerecordings (saying "punaH"), please cut out the bad portions and upload only the good portions yourself.
  - Use the scissor icon in the bottom right part of the playbackscreen of ASR - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jwqPDWs.png)

## For coordinators
- Assign small portions for recordings
- Track progress, ensure respectable pace (~ 2 hrs per week per recorder).
- Periodically gather submitted recordings, check them
- Upload to archive item.

### Feedback
- Listen to recordings via archive item/ podcast/ google drive 
- Just add a comment in the appropriate cell of the कार्यावली-sheet
- Alternatively, respond on whatsapp
