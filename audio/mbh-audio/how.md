summary: How?

## Overview
The task at hand is enormous, since Mahābhārata, together with accessory texts comes up to roughly 150,000 shloka-s. At the hands of expert reciters, assuming a rate of about 60 shloka-s an hour (including time required for rehearsal before recording), this would require a 2,450.25 hours of recording effort. Beyond that, we expect roughly the same effort for closely examining and editing the recordings. Past experience with other audio products suggest that a couple of iterations of recording, checking, rerecording might be required to remove errors.

We propose to identify and engage expert reciters (both paid ones and volunteers) with access to android phones and free mp3 recording apps (thereby bypassing studio recording costs). We will allot them chapters to record and send to us. We will then track their progress, examine the recording quality, edit as necessary and publish the final product freely (under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License) on the internet.

A past attempt by us at using volunteers to record the text had thrown up several unsurprising problems:

-   Inconsistent, unpredictable and slow progress
-   Varying quality due to varying levels of proficiency.

This we hope to surpass by adding paid expert reciters.

### Who?
The project is coordinated and conducted under the auspices of Vyoma Labs. We are grateful to have been promised a donation by the Indic Academy. With this plan to meet our expenses for this project (especially paying expert reciters).

## Record audio for us?
Are you interested in helping us? Please contact us via whatsapp (+1 650 567 6533) or email (we have an [email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mahabharata-mulam)). You can volunteer or you can choose to be paid daxiṇā (details below) - eitherway, please be aware that you *commit* to regularly produce good recordings.

### Workflow
- Set up recording apps (details below), go over instructions etc..
- Identify assigned portions from this sheet - [http://bit.ly/mbh-tasks ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sNH1AWhhoa5VATqMdLbF652s7srTG0Raa6K-sCwDR-8/edit#gid=0). "001-076" नाम प्रथमपर्वणः (नामादिपर्वणः) ७६-तमो ऽध्यायः।
- Make an mp3 recording you're satisfied with. (Note time-segments where editing is needed, or edit yourself.)
- Upload the mp3 to this google drive location - [http://bit.ly/mbh-submit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1_QBT-hoqqVMUNSLVlyMlJqZDA?usp=sharing) (but keep a copy for some time) - under a subfolder named after you.
  - See recording tips below.
- Rename the mp3 based on the parva and adhyAya recorded in this way: 001-045.mp3 (or 001-045p01.mp3 001-045p02.mp3 .. if multi-part recording.)
- Solicit and provide feedback on whatsapp forum (Especially in the beginning)
- Notify coordinator (via whatsapp or add a comment in the appropriate cell of the कार्यावली-sheet; include edit requests).

#### Expected recording quality
- Most importantly: shoot for good pronunciation - न vs ण, स vs श vs ष, अल्पप्राण (त) vs महाप्राण (थ), थ vs ध, आ vs अ (esp in the end, like in उवाच), उपध्मानीय where विसर्ग appears before पवर्ग etc.. We can coach you a bit. [Video demo](https://goo.gl/htvxdN), [शिक्षाभिप्रायः](http://vvasuki.github.io/notes/language/sanskrit/shixaa.html)
- Read without breaking sandhi-s or adding excess gaps (eg. in the end of odd pAda-s). 
- Recording should have no notification sounds, no phone call sounds.
- Recording should have no "correction sounds" - ie "रामो गच्छति काक्...काकुस्थः" or "रामो गच्छति काक्... पुनः ... रामो गच्छति काकुस्थः"
- With prose sections, where the punctuation marks ought to be, plan where you will pause for breath and how it ought to sound to convey the "conversational" bhAva.
- Our mechanical processing of recordings means that you don't have to worry about your recording sounding "too faint" when you record or hearing different volumes while listening to different adhyaaya-s or including your name in the recording filename. As long as within a recording file, the loudness is consistent and as long as information in our spreadsheet is accurate - we're fine.
- Bonus: Verse or prose: Try to render appropriate bhAva (especially in emotional spots).

#### Recording instructions
-  मध्ये दूरवाणीशब्दो (notification sound) हन्त आगतश् चेत् - ततः परं रसापकर्षणम् नास्ति। ध्वन्यङ्कनसमये दूरवाणीयन्त्रम् मौनस्थितौ ("do not disturb mode"/ "airplane mode" इत्यादिना) स्थापनीयम्। कम्पनशब्दो (vibration)ऽपि न स्यात्।
  - गणेश-सरस्वती-व्यासादीनां नमनम् प्रतिसर्गं ध्वनिमुद्रणे न स्यात् - कामम् ध्वनिमुद्रणात् पुर्वं श्रद्धया स्वतृप्त्यै कुर्यात्।
- Suggested techniques to easily create good recordings (choose whatever works well for you):
  - Break up a given long chapter into sections of (say) 20 shloka-s and make separate recordings for it. So, rather than submitting one mp3 file for a whole 163 shloka chapter, you would submit 8 mp3 files, each with about 20 shloka-s. Whenever you make an error - you just create a fresh recording for the corresponding set of 20 shloka-s.
  - Rehearse difficult shloka-s once before unpausing and recording. In case you're having much trouble: "Before each shloka, pause the recording and rehearse until you are satisfied. Then resume and make the practiced recording. Repeat for the next shloka."
  - If you make a mistake or are unsatisified, just rerecord after a 3 second silence. Later, cut out the mistake as described in the technical instructions below, and submit only the good portions.
- If despite efforts, there are shortcomings, don't worry - we can fix or replace later.

### Technical instructions
- युष्मासु तान्त्रिकविषयेषु सन्देहास् सन्ति चेत् सूचयन्तु - दूरस्थोऽपि तत्समाधाने यतिष्ये। https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings इति तन्त्रांशस्तु स्थापनीयः, येन "mobile phone screen sharing" इति सम्भवति।

#### Android setup and usage
- Install [ASR App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.asr&hl=en)
- Set up the app as needed:
  - Consider enabling noise cancellation (PS: Note that this reduces recording volume, but that's ok - it'll be adjusted after you submit the file).
  - Recording format: mp3, disable "recording in stereo".
  - Optional settings: Sample rate 44.1kHz, Bitrate 64 kbps.
- Pause and proceed during recording as needed. Don't pause in the middle of a verse to avoid jitters - only pause between verses.
- *Removing errors*: In case there are mistakes in the middle of a recording, you can use the scissor icon in the bottom right part of the playbackscreen of ASR to save the "good portions" as separate files, which you can later submit as a multipart recording of the allotted chapter

#### Iphone setup and usage
- Install [mp3-voice-recorder-audio-note](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mp3-voice-recorder-audio-note/id891186831?mt=8)

### Expectations with paid recorders
Before engaging someone as a paid recorder, to ensure adequate quality and ability - we will ask for a sample recording of an assigned chapter.

When we engage someone as a paid recorder we will have a clear understanding about:
- the expected quality of recording (described in this website)
- the expected daxiṇā per shloka in properly and timely recordings of assigned chapters (PS: the greater the rate of good quality recordings, the greater the daxiṇā per shloka)
- the expected rate of output. (कियता कालेन पठनीयम् इति नैके ऽपृच्छन्। भवतां पठनक्षमताम् अनुसृत्य पठनार्थम् अध्यायान् सूचयिष्यामः - वयन्तु यावच्छीघ्रं ध्वनिमुद्रणानि सङ्गृहीतुं वाञ्छामः। उदाहरणाय- यदि दिने २०० श्लोकान् पठितुम् अस्ति क्षमता, तन्मात्रान् अध्यायान् पठनार्थं समर्पयामः। अवरपक्षे तु दिने १०० श्लोकान् पठितुं प्रयतध्वम्।)

Further, a formal agreement will be signed with Vyoma Labs.

The daxiṇā will be dispatched periodically (monthly at the latest). We will keep track of shloka-s (submitted, checked and accepted) so as to accurately calculate the amount due.

## For coordinators
- Induct recording volunteers, and gather payment details (agreement pdf - [bit.ly/mbh-sandhi-v1](http://bit.ly/mbh-sandhi-v1), source [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kqnLzqgQqWx4KUE5ZoS-H6yGv2TT7xf2)).
- Assign small portions for recordings depending on recorder's capacity.
- Track progress, ensure respectable pace.
- Periodically gather submitted recordings, check them, suggest corrections.
- Once a satisfactory initial recording is obtained, do the following (Useful scripts here: [mbh_audio](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/audio_curation/tree/master/curation_projects)):
  - normalize the audio
    - change from sterio to mono
    - set loudness to 16dbfs
  - add mp3 tags identifying the reciter in the standard way
  - upload to github and the archive item.

### Feedback
- Listen to recordings via archive item/ podcast/ google drive 
- Just add a comment in the appropriate cell of the कार्यावली-sheet
- Also, respond on whatsapp
